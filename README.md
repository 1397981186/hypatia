# Hypatia

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snkas/hypatia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snkas/hypatia)

Hypatia is a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite network simulation framework.

It consists of four main components:

* `satgenpy` : Python framework to generate LEO satellite networks and generate 
  routing over time over a period of time. It additionally includes several 
  analysis tools to study individual cases. 
  (license: MIT)

* `ns3-sat-sim` : ns-3 based framework which takes as input the state generated 
  by `satgenpy` to perform packet-level simulations over LEO satellite networks.
  It makes use of the `satellite` ns-3 module by Pedro Silva to calculate
  satellite locations over time.
  (license: GNU GPL version 2)
  
* `satviz` : Cesium visualization pipeline to generate interactive satellite network
  visualizations. It makes use of the online Cesium API by generating CesiumJS code.
  The API calls require its user to obtain a Cesium access token (via [https://cesium.com/]()).
  More information can be found in `satviz/README.md`.
  (license: MIT)

* `paper` : Experimental and plotting code to reproduce the experiments and 
  figures which are presented in the paper.
  (license: MIT)
  
(there is a fifth folder called `integration_tests` which is used for integration testing purposes)

This is the code repository introduced and used in "Exploring the “Internet from space” with Hypatia" 
by Simon Kassing*, Debopam Bhattacherjee*, André Baptista Águas, Jens Eirik Saethre and Ankit Singla
(*equal contribution), which is published in the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) 2020.

## Getting started

1. System setup:
   - Python version 3.7+
   - Recent Linux operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 18+)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bash hypatia_install_dependencies.sh
   ```
   
3. Build all four modules (as far as possible):
   ```
   bash hypatia_build.sh
   ```
   
4. Run tests:
   ```
   bash hypatia_run_tests.sh
   ```

5. The reproduction of the paper is essentially the tutorial for Hypatia.
